%#step 3: evaluation of performance

%#using our third set of prices, we estimate dp at each time interval,
%#if dp > t and current position <= 0 , we buy
%#if dp < -t and current position >= 0, we sell
%#else, do nothing

%#trade using the above algorithm. returns expected profit

%#given a list of prices
%#assumes k-means clustered patterns have already been calculated
%#assumes parameters w_i have already been calculated
%#position is -1, 0 or 1 (we have sold a bitcoin, done nothing, bought a bitcoin)
%#bank is the amount of cash we have
%#threshold is the threshold for buying/selling
